			<section>
				<h3>SOLID what?</h3>
				<p>
					Acronym for 5 principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
				</p>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- understandable = readable, has predictible order
					- flexible = easier to add features
					- maintainable = easier to make changes to existing features
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Origins</h3>
				<ul style="text-align: left;">
					<li>
						introduced in 2000 by Robert C. Martin, aka Uncle Bob, in his paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns".
					</li>
					<li>
						The SOLID acronym was coined later by Michael Feathers
					</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- uncle bobs paper introduced more principles, resource at end of slides
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Some reasons to learn this</h3>
				<ul style="text-align: left;">
					<li>
						You've probably been practicing some (if not all) of these principles instinctively and unconsciously.<br />
						Its good to "formalize" this and be conscious about it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Gives extra points to think about in code review (or refactor)
					</li>
					<li>
						Can be applied to all levels of software, from code to architecture.
					</li>
					<li>
						Job interviews: some universities teach this and some workplaces expect you to know this (my uni didn't btw)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h3>!important: Principles, not Rules</h3>
				<p>
					As with any other principle in life, every SOLID principle can be misused or overused to the extent of being
					counterproductive
				</p>


				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- some links to misuse at resources at end of slides
					- will talk mostly about what each principle is, but will also try to talk about what it is NOT
				</aside>

				</table>
				<p>Lets examine them one by one</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Single Responsibility Principle</h3>
				<small>A class should have one, and only one, reason to change</small>
			</section>
			<section>
				<ul>
					<li>Keep classes focused on one area of functionality</li>
					<li>If a new area is needed, put it in another class</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In other words, SRP encourages you to divide and group similar functionality into different classes</p>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					this might sound straightforward and obvious, but its really easy and tempting to pile on FN on an existing
					class and I bet you did this in the past (I certainly did)
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Benefits of SRP</h3>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Readability</strong> - Classes that do many things are hard to follow.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Testability</strong> – Breaking down your code into small modules makes them easier to test.</li>
					<li><b>Maintainability</b> – change to an area of responsibility will likely only occur in the class
						responsible for it.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- readability: As your applications grow in size and complexity, readability becomes one of the top
					priorities.
					- maintenance: you will not break tests of other modules

					surface of change. solid principles reduce the "surface of change" for maintenance or adding new features.
					less surface of change = less bugs = more reliable
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>example of class evolving and violating SRP</section>

			<section>
				Requirements: <br />
				Canvas with width, height and can draw a char on it:
				<pre>
					<code class="hljs">
class Canvas {
	val contents[][]
	val height, width

	private def inBounds(x,y)

	def drawPointAt(x,y, char) = {
		if (inBounds) contents[x][y] = char
	}

	def drawLine(x1,y1, x2, y2) = { only supports horizontal line }

	def toString = contents.map(_.mkString).mkString
}
					</code>
				</pre>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<div>New requirement of saving canvas to file might result in this implementation:</div>
				<pre>
					<code class="hljs">
class Canvas {
	... 
	def saveToFile(filepath) = { serialize somehow to file }
}
					</code>
				</pre>
			</section>
			<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

			</aside>
			<section>
				<p>SRP violation: Canvas now has 2 unrelated reasons to change</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Canvas model changes: if drawLine should also support vertical</li>
					<li>Save to file changes: if file should be saved in a different way</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

			</aside>
			<section>
				<p>Solve the violation by separating saving to file to its own class</p>
				<pre>
					<code class="hljs">
class CanvasFileSaver {
	def saveToFile(canvas) = ...
} 
					</code>
				</pre>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Caution!</h4>
				<p>Careful of interpreting this as "class should have one job only"</p>
				<p>You might end up with a simple functionality divided between 5 classes each with a 4 liner function</p>

				<p>"one reason to change" should be a business logic related reason or an important technical one</p>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					remember, principles not rules. i added some links in resources in end of slides showing misuse and talking
					about "what is one reason to change".
				</aside>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h3>Open Closed Principle</h3>
				<p><small>originaly stated as:</small></p>
				<small>Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification</small>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p><small>But later phrased in a better way by Uncle Bob as:</small></p>
				<p>You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it</p>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					The idea behind the Open Closed Principle is to ensure that the classes have scope for extension in the future
					and that this extension will not break existing code.<br />
					New features are added by extending or writing new code without modifying old code.<br />
					Old code remains unchanged, tested and this reliable.
				</p>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Benefits of OCP</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Reliability –</strong> Existing code is closed to modification. adding new features will not
						require changing old code. So existing code stays tested, unchanged and thus reliable.</li>
					<li><strong>Agility</strong> – Code is open to adding new features via extension. making the development
						process fast and agile as less (or no) refactoring of old code is required to add new features.</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					again, surface of change. solid principles reduce the "surface of change" for maintenance or adding new
					features. less surface of change = less bugs = more reliable
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Example</p>
				<p>
					We have a TicketPrice class, which holds a price for a ticket.<br />
					The price can be discounted according to the customer type.<br/>
					A PriceCalculator class performs this discount check.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Implementation might initially look like this:</p>
				<pre><code class="hljs">
case class TicketPrice(price)

class PriceCalculator {
	def getDiscountedPrice(ticketPrice) = {
		if(customer == 'vip') {
			return ticketPrice.price * 0.25;
		}
		else if(customer == 'family') {
			return ticketPrice.price * 0.5;
		}
		else return ticketPrice.price;
	}
}
			</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Adding customer types or changing the behavior of an existing type would break the existing tests for this
					code</p>
				<p>This is where the Open Closed Principle can help</p>
			</section>


			<section>
				<p>
					Lets refactor according to OCP.
				</p>
				<pre><code class="hljs">
class PriceCalculator {
	def getDiscountedPrice(ticketPrice) = {
			return ticketPrice.getDiscountedPrice();
	}
}
									</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					Discount calculation according to customer types go in their own classes:
				<pre><code class="hljs">
class TicketPrice {
	def getDiscountedPrice() = price
}

class VIPDiscount extends TicketPrice {
	def getDiscountedPrice() = {
		return price * 0.25;
	}
}

class FamilyDiscount extends TicketPrice {
	def getDiscountedPrice() = {
		return price * 0.5;
	}
}
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>In this way, we can continue adding more discount types without breaking the core PriceCalculator behavior</p>

				<p>In other words, PriceCalculator is
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Open for extension</strong> by adding new types of discount in new classes. </li>
						<li><strong>Closed for modification</strong> because discount changes are not done in the original PriceCalculator code.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Disclaimer for next 2 principles</h3>
				<p>
					The examples for the Liskov Substitution and Interface Segregation principles might look like these principles
					were made only for staticaly typed languages.<br/> 
					But actually the principles can also be applied to dynamic langs and also on higher levels (architecture, system etc)
				</p>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					there are ruby and javascript examples for both on the web
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Liskov Substitution Principle</h3>
				<small>Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes</small>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre><code class="hljs">
class Bird{
	def fly() = { fly }
}
class Eagle extends Bird {
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
	override def fly() = { throw new Exception("cant fly") }
}
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p><strong>Ostrich is a bird, but it cant fly!</strong></p>
				<p>So if you had to iterate over birds and make them fly:</p>
				<pre><code class="hljs">
for (bird: birds) {
	if (bird instanceOf Ostrich) {
		//noop - to avoid an error being thrown
	} else bird.fly()
}
					</code></pre>
				<p>this invalidates the Liskov Substitution Principle because an Ostrich cant be a (safe) substitute for bird - it throws exception on fly</p>
			</section>


			<section>
				<p>refactor according to LSP to</p>
				<pre><code class="hljs">
class Bird {
	def makeSound() // only fns that all birds have!
}
class FlyingBirds extends Bird {
	def fly() = { fly... }
} 

class Eagle extends FlyingBirds {}
class Ostrich extends Bird {}
								
for (bird: birds) bird.makeSound()
for (bird: flyingBirds) bird.fly() //safe now
				</code></pre>
				</p>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					and this also helps enforce OCP in places where this kind of loop is used.
				</aside>

			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Benefits of LSP are Maintainability & Reliability:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>When extending base classes, you don't need to worry about overriding (or forgetting to) a fn of a base class to be a no-op (or throw exception) </li>
					<li>When using a collection of the base class, you don't need to check instanceOf and can assume the base methods are safe</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Rule of thumb</h3>
				<p>
					If you find yourself writing instanceOf or overriding your own base class functions to do nothing, you should
					do something about it.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Caution</h3>
				<p>
					Don't try to forsee all future extensions of a base class.<br/>
					It's ok to start with something and later refactor it<br/>
					YAGNI approach.
				</p>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					it can be hard (or unintuitive) to know in advance what fns an interface will have "forever".

					its definitely ok to start with "all birds can fly" assumption and refactor first when the violation is detected by introduction of ostrich.

					the YAGNI approach is great "You aren't gonna need it": Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them
				</aside>
			</section>

			


			<section>
				<h3>Interface Segregation Principle</h3>
				<small>Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific</small>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Interface Segregation Principle is about avoiding "Fat" interfaces</p>
				<p>This usually happens gradually. Starting from a small interface with a simple implementation that slowly
					grows</p>
				<p>Lets look at an example</p>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>We start with a simple Worker interface that can work and eat:</p>
				<pre><code class="hljs">
interface Worker {
	def work()
	def eat()
}

class NormalWorker implements Worker {
	def work() = { ... }
	def eat() = { ... }
}

class SlowWorker implements Worker { same but slower }
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>A new requirement for a Robot worker arrives. <br/>
					A robot doesn't eat</p>

				<pre><code class="hljs">
class RobotWorker implements Worker {
	def work() = { /* robot work */ }
	def eat() = { /* do nothing */ }
}
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>This violates ISP</p>
				<p>
					Our common interface Worker has now become "Fat" and contains methods that some of its  implementations don't need
				</p>
				<p>The solution is simple: </p>
				<small>Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific</small>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Separate the big interface to smaller ones:</p>
				<pre><code class="hljs">
interface Workable { def work() }
interface Feedable { def eat() }

class NormalWorker implements Workable, Feedable {
	...
}

class Robot implements Workable {
	...
}
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					A nice saying is that Interface Segregation and Liskov Substitution are <strong>Two sides of the same coin</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					ISP cares about "client" side - keeping clients from implementing your interfaces in an unsafe way (no-op or throw exceptions).
				</p>
				<p>
					LSP is about the "server" side - keeping you from from writing potentially dangerous code (runtime errs)
				</p>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h3>Dependency Inversion Principle</h3>
				<small>Depend on abstractions, not on concretions</small>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p><strong>The Dependency-Inversion Principle consists of two rules:</strong></p>
				<ol style="text-align: left;">
					<li>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</li>
					<li>Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.</li>
				</ol>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- rule 2:
					- details (such as mysql db) should depend on some IDB.
					- the IDB should avoid having those details.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p><strong>What are high and low levels?</strong></p>
				<ol style="text-align: left;">
					<li>
						<strong>Low-level</strong> - concrete implementation including the small details such as connection protocl, file I/O, storage etc
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>High-level</strong> - business rules and the bigger picture
					</li>
				</ol>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Example of dependency inversion</h3>
				<img src="dependency_inversion.png" />
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Benefits OR "Why avoid high-level modules depending on low-level?"</p>
				<ul style="text-align: left;">
					<li>When we make a change in a low-level module, we want to prevent that we also need to make changes a	high-level module. <br />
						We want to minimize the "surface of change".</li>
					<li>High-level modules (biz rules) are easier to reuse when they aren't tightly coupled to low-level modules.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- low level changes: Things like the user interface, the communication with web services, persistence
					regularly receive more updates than business rules and policies.
					- reuse example: when we want to provide a new interface like a mobile app of API
				</aside>
			</section>


			<section>
				<p>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is often confused with:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Inversion of Control (IoC)</li>
					<li>Dependency Injection (DI)</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<hr />
				<p>IoC is just inversing the control, the opposite of IoC is control! </p>

				<div style="text-align: left;">
					Strategy Pattern is a nice example because code usign it hands over control to the strategy.
				</div>
				<hr />

				<p>Dependency Injection is just a combination IoC and DIP to manage dependencies</p>

				<div style="text-align: left;">
					IoC: Instead of classes instantiating their dependencies, they give control to a DI framework.<br/>
					DIP: classes depend on an abstraction, the DI framework knows the concrete (low-level) instance needed.
				</div>
				<hr />
